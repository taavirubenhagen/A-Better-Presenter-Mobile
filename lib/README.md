This project uses the Tavy Raw Design System.

In this directory, a dart file name in capital letters, like EXAMPLE.dart, indicates a file that is **critical for backwards compatibility** or the correct functioning of basic app features.
The features a particular file is responsible for are explained in an all-caps Dartdoc comment at the top of the file.
**These features must only rely on the corresponding file, which has to be edited with absolute caution.**
Import them with the alias that is specified in the Dartdoc comment of the file. This alias defaults to the file name.
